# Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

This project implements a **spam classifier** using machine learning algorithms to classify messages as spam or not spam. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process text data and build a robust model for spam detection.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To classify text messages as spam or not spam with high accuracy.
- **Approach**: Utilize machine learning models and NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaning and tokenizing text data.
  - Removing stop words and punctuations.
  - Converting text to lowercase.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Vectorization using techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implementation of algorithms like:
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Logistic Regression
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the classifier.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains labeled text messages with two categories:
  - **Spam**: Messages classified as unsolicited or promotional.
  - **Ham**: Legitimate messages.
- Sample dataset fields:
  - `label`: Indicates if the message is spam or not.
  - `text`: The content of the message.

## Technology Stack

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and evaluation.
  - `nltk`: For natural language processing.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: For visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding and visualizations.
